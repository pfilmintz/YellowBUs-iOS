# YellowBUs-iOS
Bus booking app where users can book a seat, pay via mobile money and track location of buses. 
- I used UIKit and Auto layout to build UI.
- Alamofire for API calls
- Firebase for backend to store user data 
- Firebase cloud functions to receive payment response from payment provider 
- Realm to store user transactions history locally
